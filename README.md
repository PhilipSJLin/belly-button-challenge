# Belly Button Biodiversity

## **Descripton**
This is an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://github.com/PhilipSJLin/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/Data/samples.json) (you can also locate it in `data/samples.json`), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. <br/>
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.<br/>

## **Dashboard Features**
 *Drop Down Menu*
  - Select the Test Subject ID No. with the drop down menu to toggle the visualizations
  
  *Demographic Info Panel*
  - This Panel shows the demographics information of the chosen test subject
  - Displays each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object
  
  *Horizontal Bar Graph*
  - A bar chart is generated when a test subject is selected on the drop menu

  *Gauge Chart*
  - A gauge chart is generated when a test subject is selected on the drop menu
  
  *Bubble Chart*
  - A bubble chart is generated when a test subject is selected on the drop menu
  - Each sample will be display as a bubble, where the larger the sample value is the larger the bubble size

## **Data**
For our challenge, I have visualized data extracted from the following dataset available in the Data folder <br/>
   * samples.json <br/>

## **Tools Used**
*  Plotly<br/>
*  D3 Library<br/>
